# Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

## **Requirements**

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## **Installation**

Install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn




**## **Dataset********

The dataset used is breast-cancer.csv. It contains features related to breast cancer cases, including the diagnosis label.

**Code Overview
**Imports: Essential libraries and modules are imported.
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Load the dataset.
Handle missing data and encode categorical labels.
Data Normalization:
Normalize feature values to a range of 0-1.
Train-Test Split:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Building:
Train a Logistic Regression model.
Evaluation:
Predict and evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, MSE, and R-squared.
Visualize the results using confusion matrix heatmaps.
Prediction:
Use the model to make predictions on new data.
